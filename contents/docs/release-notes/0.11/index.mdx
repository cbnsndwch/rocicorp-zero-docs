## Features

- Windows support. Thank you very much to [aexylus](https://aexylus.com/) and [Sergio Leon](https://www.cbnsndwch.io/) for the testing and contributions here.
- The `IS` operator now supports `null` ([docs](https://www.cbnsndwch.io/)).
- Support nested property access in JWT auth tokens ([docs](/docs/permissions#rules)). 
- Make initial sync configurable ([docs](/docs/zero-cache-config#initial-sync-table-copy-workers)).
- Add `resultType` to SolidJS ([docs](/docs/reading-data#completeness))
- Docker image now contains native amd64 and arm64 binaries.

## Fixes

Many, many minor fixes, including:

- Fix downstream replication of primitive values
- Fix replication of `TRUNCATE` messages
- Fix large storage use for idle pg instances
- Add runtime sanity checks for when a table is referenced but not synced
- Fix `zero-cache-dev` for multitenant


## Breaking Changes

- The addition of `resultType` to SolidJS is a breaking API change. See the changes to [`hello-zero-solid`](TODO) for upgrade example.
