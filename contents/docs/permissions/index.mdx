title: Permissions

Permissions are expressed using [ZQL](reading-data) and run automatically with every read and write.

## Define Permissions

Permissions are defined in [`schema.ts`](/docs/zero-schema) using the `definePermissions` function.

Here's an example of limiting deletes to only the creator of an issue:

```ts
// The decoded value of your JWT.
type AuthData = {
  // The logged-in user.
  sub: string;
};

export const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<IssueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        delete: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      },
    },
  };
});
```

`definePermission` returns a _policy_ object for each table in the schema. Each policy defines a _ruleset_ for the _operations_ that are possible on a table: `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.

<Note type="danger">
If a policy is not defined for a table or operation, Zero currently ***allows*** the operation.

This is not a very safe default, but it is productive. We will likely flip this default in the future.

</Note>

## Rules

Each operation on a policy has a _ruleset_ containing zero or more _rules_.

A rule is just a TypeScript function that receives the logged in user's `AuthData` and generates a ZQL [where expression](reading-data#compound-filters). At least one rule in a ruleset must return a row for the operation to be allowed.

## Select Permissions

You can limit the data a user can read by specifying a `select` ruleset.

Select permissions act like filters. If a user does not have permission to read a row, it will be filtered out of the result set. It will not generate an error.

For example, imagine a select permission that restricts reads to only issues created by the user:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      select: [allowIfIssueCreator],
    },
  };
});
```

If the issue table has two rows, one created by the user and one by someone else, the user will only see the row they created in any queries.

## Insert Permissions

You can limit what rows can be inserted and by whom by specifying an `insert` ruleset.

Insert rules are evaluated after the entity is inserted. So if they query the database, they will see the inserted row present. If any rule in the insert ruleset returns a row, the insert is allowed.

Here's an example of an insert rule that disallows inserting users that have the role 'admin'.

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfNonAdmin = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof userSchema>,
  ) => cmp('role', '!=', 'admin');

  return {
    user: {
      insert: [allowIfNonAdmin],
    },
  };
});
```

## Update Permissions

There are two types of update rulesets: `preMutation` and `postMutation`.

`preMutation` rules are evaluated before the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like checking whether a user owns an entity before editing it. `postMutation` rules are evaluated after the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like restricting the kinds of changes a user is allowed to make.

Both the `preMutation` and `postMutation` rulesets must allow an update. But note that as with other rulesets, if either `preMutation` or `postMutation` ruleset is undefined, it defaults to **_allow_**.

So this allows an edit if the user is the creator of the issue:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      preMutation: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      // postMutation defaults to _allow_.
    },
  };
});
```

And this allows an edit if the the loggged in user is the creator after the edit:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      // preMutation defaults to _allow_.
      postMutation: [allowIfIssueCreator],
    },
  };
});
```

But this policy will never allow an edit, because the two rulesets can't be true at the same time:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  const allowIfNotIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '!=', authData.sub);

return {
    issue: {
      preMutation: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      postMutation: [allowIfNotIssueCreator],
    },
  };
});
```

## Delete Permissions

Delete permissions work in the same way as `insert` positions except they run _before_ the delete is applied. So if a delete rule queries the database, it will see that the deleted row is present. If any rule in the ruleset returns a row, the delete is allowed.

## Helpers

Zero defines the `ANYONE_CAN` and `NOBODY_CAN` helpers to make these common cases more readable. They are just named constants for `undefined` (anyone) and `[]` (nobody).

```ts
export const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        // anyone can insert issues
        insert: ANYONE_CAN,
        // nobody can delete issues
        delete: NOBODY_CAN,
      },
    },
  };
});
```
